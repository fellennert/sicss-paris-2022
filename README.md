# Intro

This repository contains the code and slides used for teaching the 2022 edition of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Paris. The R script can also be found in bookdown form [here](https://bookdown.org/f_lennert/bookdown_script/). Relevant data are available from dropbox, code for directly loading the script into the session is included in the scripts. Hence, no data needs to be downloaded upfront.

Make sure that you have installed a current version of R and RStudio before running the scripts. Start with the [index file](bookdown_script/index.Rmd) and run the first chunk. This will install all packages you require for running the code. We assume familiarity with R and mostly follow the "tidy dialect." If you are entirely unfamiliar with this, you can find introductory material in the final section of the [index file](bookdown_script/index.Rmd).

The scripts are ordered in the way the material is taught. Throughout the course, the theory behind the concepts will be introduced in the morning lectures and the practical implementation in R in the afternoon sessions.

The following list connects the corresponding files:

* Day 1: intro to CSS and ethical considerations ([Slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/index.Rmd)
* Day 2: scraping structured content from the web ([slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/01-scraping_structured.Rmd))
* Day 3: scraping unstructured content from the web ([slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/02-scraping_unstructured.Rmd)
* Day 4: text preprocessing ([slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/03-scraping_unstructured.Rmd)
* Day 5: classification and prediction with text ([slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/04-scraping_unstructured.Rmd)
* Day 6: advanced language modeling ([slides](), [R material](bookdown_script/02-scraping_unstructured.Rmd)

The solutions to the exercises are included in the script. You can use [this RMD file](bookdown_script/_exercise_file.Rmd) to get the "raw exercises" without solutions.
